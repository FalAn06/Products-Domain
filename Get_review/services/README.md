# Services Folder 🛠️ - Handles Business Logic and API Routes

## 📦 Folder Overview

The **services** folder is responsible for containing the business logic and API routes for the **Get Review Microservice**. This folder plays a key role in processing the review data, interacting with the database, and returning responses to the API client. It is where the main functionality of the review service is defined, including fetching reviews from the database.

### 🛠 Key Components:
- **review_service.py**: Contains the logic for handling the retrieval of product reviews. This file is where the connection to the database is made, and the logic for querying the reviews is executed.
- **__init__.py**: This is an initialization file that marks the directory as a Python package, making it possible to import the service into other parts of the application.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Services Folder

The services folder is crucial for implementing the core business logic of the **Get Review Microservice**. It allows the application to:
- Interact with the **MongoDB** database to fetch product reviews.
- Provide the API functionality for retrieving reviews for a specific product.
- Return the reviews in a clean, structured JSON format.

## ⚙️ review_service.py

The **review_service.py** file includes:
- A **MongoDB** connection to retrieve reviews for specific products.
- A function called `get_reviews()`, which takes the `productId` as a query parameter, fetches the corresponding reviews from the database, and formats them for the response.

## 🌟 Future Enhancements

- **Pagination**: Implement pagination to limit the number of reviews returned for large product datasets.
- **Review Search**: Add functionality to search for reviews based on keywords or ratings.
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling to cover more edge cases, such as database connection failures.

This folder is central to the operation of the **Get Review Microservice**, ensuring that the review data is processed correctly and efficiently.
